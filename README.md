1. What is NumPy?
NumPy (short for "Numerical Python") is a foundational package for numerical computations in Python. It provides support
for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a host of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
2.Why NumPy?
 Performance: NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python lists for numerical operations. 
 Functionality: NumPy provides a plethora of built-in functions for linear algebra, statistical operations, and much more.
 Interoperability: Many other data science libraries (like Pandas, Scikit-learn) are built on top of NumPy.

3. Getting Started with NumPy Arrays
The core functionality of NumPy is its ndarray, or N-dimensional array object. This is a homogeneous collection of items
(usually numbers), which can be indexed using integers.
